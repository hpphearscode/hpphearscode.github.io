# My Academic Story

Bottom line: If I can make it, you can, too!

## Where I started
I am originally from Shanghai, China. As a kid, I was obsessed with dinosaurs, Go, and GameBoy Color. I have always been curious about everything, and quite stubborn - if I'm puzzled with something, I can't let it go easily.
But my curiosity didn't really fit in - our educational system promoted good scores on standardized tests. I was lost - why am I learning again?

My middle school days felt like a blur - I did the bare minimums the goal was simply to get by. This era was marked with my newly found obsession with basketball and of course, more computer games. 

High school was a total mess. The bare minimums didn't work no more - I started getting scores half of my classmates'. And of course, without knowing why I needed to study, I gave up. But fortunately, I had a group of gifted friends who didn't really care how bad I did on exams.
We simply enjoyed playing sports and games together, hanging out was always a blast. Because of this, I gave up on school, but I didn't give up on myself.

- Emotion perception
- Hearing aids / speech processing
- fNIRS (optional: why it matters)

## What I’m building toward
A paragraph about your long-term goal (e.g., clinician-scientist, translational impact, etc.).

## Outside the lab (optional)
1–2 lines: teaching, mentoring, outreach, hobbies—whatever you want people to remember.
